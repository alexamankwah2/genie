## How it works
- The user interacts with the app by inputting queries or prompts.
- The frontend sends the user's input to the backend, which then calls the OpenAI API with the provided input and API key.
- The OpenAI API processes the input and returns a generated response.
- The backend sends the generated response back to the frontend, which displays it to the user.
